- no readme?
- good effort
- put in a seed script
- why the public directory?
- do some more planning before writing code
- thing about file naming and route naming
- plan out your routes better
- you really should only have two routes
- /api/products/map - get's a list of active letters
- /api/producst/:letter - get's a list of products with a letter
